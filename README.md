# ML Portfolio

A collection of machine learning and data science projects demonstrating skills in **EDA, feature engineering, model development, and deployment-ready project structures**.  
This repo is structured to reflect how ML workflows are handled in real projects, ranging from scratch implementations to applied use cases.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Tabular EDA**: Batting, Bowling, and Fielding datasets  
- **Time-series & Text-based EDA**: Structured for expansion  
- Notebook: `eda_tabular.ipynb`

### 📊 Regression
- **House Price Prediction (Ames dataset)**  
  - Modular pipeline (`src/`) for data processing, feature engineering, and modeling  
  - Separate folders for raw/processed data, models, and reports  
  - Notebook: `house_price_pred.ipynb`

### 🧮 Classification
- **Iris Flower Classification**: Baseline classification workflow

### 🔜 Upcoming Projects
- Customer Churn Predictor  
- Titanic Survival Prediction  
- Linear Regression (from scratch)  
- Image Classification System  
- Sentiment Analysis System

## 🛠️ Reusable Modules
Located under `src/`:
- **Visualization tools**: barplot, boxplot, heatmap, scatterplot, histograms, correlation tables, decision boundary plots  
- Designed to keep plots consistent and reusable across projects

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-portfolio.git
cd ml-portfolio
````

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Roadmap

This portfolio will expand to cover:

1. Core ML algorithms from scratch
2. Applied ML problems across domains (tabular, text, image, time-series)
3. End-to-end pipelines (EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → reporting)

---

## 📌 Note

This is a **living repository** – more projects and improvements will be added over time.
The goal is to build a **production-grade ML portfolio through modular, focused projects**, not just a collection of notebooks.
